# coupon_on_blockchain
Ethereum smart contract for coupons/notes exchange.  
This repository is a part of my project: **Simple coupons/notes dispatching protocol on Ethereum blockchain platform**   
Source code of Android client app is available at my repo [dangnh0611/ethereum_coupon_client](https://github.com/dangnh0611/ethereum_coupon_client). 

## About this project
- Develop smart contracts with Vyper that simplify [The Rourge Protocol](https://rouge.network).
    - Issuer is the issuer of coupons. A coupons is only valid when its issuer is validated.
    - Distributors are who give coupons to users. Usually, they are influential individuals/organizations, such as streamers, bloggers, websites, .. Issuer must pay fees (ETH) to each distributors depending on the number of customers referred by them.
    - Bearers are users looking for discounted notes/coupons opportunities.
- Develop two Android client apps for Issuer/Distributor and Bearer actors.
## Technologies: 
- Vyper
- Java (Android)
- Web3j
- Infura
- Ropsten Test Network.
